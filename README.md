<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am an ardent environmental scientist with a multidisciplinary focus, particularly in hydrology, river system networks, and leveraging machine learning for disaster management in Bangladesh's coastal lands and islands. My academic background includes a Master's in Environmental Science from the University of Chittagong, equipping me with a strong foundation in GIS, remote sensing, and watershed management. Engaged in diverse projects, my research spans the intricate dynamics of soil-water interactions, understanding river systems' behaviors, and innovating machine learning applications to predict and mitigate disasters in vulnerable coastal areas.

I like to travel and explore nature, listen podcasts, perticipate in sports and create content on YouTube.

**Research Interests**

Numerical modeling of hydrologic processes on coastal land.  
Investigating the interplay between soil properties and water movement to enhance land management strategies.  
GIS and Remote Sensing.  
Employing machine learning methodologies to analyze precipitation and surface-groundwater flow patterns and preemptively control flash floods.
