**About me**

I am an ardent environmental scientist with a multidisciplinary focus, particularly in hydrology, river system networks, and leveraging machine learning for disaster management in Bangladesh's coastal lands and islands. My academic background includes a Master's in Environmental Science from the University of Chittagong, equipping me with a strong foundation in GIS, remote sensing, and watershed management. Engaged in diverse projects, my research spans the intricate dynamics of soil-water interactions, understanding river systems' behaviors, and innovating machine learning applications to predict and mitigate disasters in vulnerable coastal areas.


**Research Interests**

My research interests revolve around hydrology, investigating the interplay between soil properties and water movement to enhance land management strategies. Additionally, I'm deeply invested in studying river system networks, focusing on predictive modeling techniques to forecast runoff patterns and evaluate watershed responses to land-use changes. A key focus area of my research involves employing machine learning methodologies to analyze wave patterns and preemptively control disasters in Bangladesh's coastal regions and islands. My goal is to bridge scientific insights with practical applications to ensure sustainable environmental practices and disaster resilience in these vulnerable ecosystems.
