#### Current Project
Predicting hydrological response of Ganges, Brahmaputra, Meghna basin to GeoMIP climate model data.  
**Supervisor:** Dr. Shyamal Karmakar  

In this project we are trying to see how three major rivers of delta rigon response to GeoMIP projected climate data to assess its impact using SWAT tool. We used QGIS interface for developing modell. To assess the modell performance (R2, NSE, PBIAS) SWAT-CUP has been used.
